refactor(prisma): upgrade to prisma 7 and centralize configuration

This commit upgrades Prisma from v6 to v7 and refactors the configuration
to align with modern best practices, improving developer experience and
CI/CD robustness.

Key Changes:

- **Prisma v7 Upgrade:** Upgraded `@prisma/client` and `prisma` packages
  from 6.19.1 to 7.2.0.
- **Centralized Configuration:** Replaced the deprecated `package.json#prisma`
  key and consolidated configuration into a new `prisma.config.ts` file.
  The `_base.prisma` file was removed as its contents are now managed
  by this central config.
- **Standardized DB Scripts:** Introduced standard `pnpm` scripts
  (`db:migrate`, `db:migrate:dev`, etc.) for all database operations.
- **CI/CD Integration:**
  - `pr-checks` workflow now validates that schema changes have a
    corresponding migration.
  - `deploy` workflow now automatically runs database migrations, ensuring
    the database is in sync with the deployed code.
