refactor(backend): streamline user and auth context handling

Removed direct `User` import from `@prisma/client` in `dev-auth.strategy.ts` and
`users.controller.ts`.

Simplified the hardcoded user object in `dev-auth.strategy.ts` to include only
essential fields, aligning it with the core authenticated user context.

`users.controller.ts` now directly uses `express.Request` and relies on the
global authentication guard to attach the authenticated user object to `req.user`.
Renamed `updateMe` to `updateProfile` in `users.controller.ts` for better
semantics.

These changes enhance modularity, consistency, and reduce direct dependencies
on Prisma client types in application logic, promoting a more robust
authentication flow.
