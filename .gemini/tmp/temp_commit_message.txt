refactor(backend): restructure backend application

This commit introduces a major refactoring of the backend application to improve modularity and align with NestJS best practices. The new structure organizes the application into distinct modules and a shared kernel.

Key changes:
- **Modularization**: Business logic is now organized into modules (`auth`, `health`).
- **Shared Kernel**: Common functionalities like decorators, exceptions, and the Prisma module are moved to a `shared` directory.
- **Prisma Schema**: The Prisma schema path in the documentation has been updated to reflect the new directory-based structure.
- **Auth Module**: The authentication logic has been encapsulated within its own module.
