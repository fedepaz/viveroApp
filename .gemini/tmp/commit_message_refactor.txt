feat(backend-auth): implement strategy pattern for authentication

This commit introduces a strategy pattern for authentication in the
backend's `auth` module. This allows for dynamic selection of
authentication mechanisms (e.g., development fallback, Clerk) based on the
environment, improving flexibility and testability.

Key changes:
- `AuthModule`: Configured a factory provider to inject either
  `DevAuthStrategy` or `ClerkAuthStrategy` based on `NODE_ENV`.
- `GlobalAuthGuard`: Updated to use the injected `AuthStrategy` for
  authentication validation, centralizing the authentication flow.
- Added `AuthStrategy` interface and concrete implementations for
  development and Clerk authentication.
