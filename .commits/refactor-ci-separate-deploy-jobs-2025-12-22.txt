refactor(ci): separate frontend and backend deployment jobs

Refactors the `deploy.yml` workflow to improve clarity and efficiency
by separating the deployment process into distinct `frontend` and
`backend` jobs. This change aligns the CI/CD pipeline more closely
with the documented principle of Separation of Concerns.

- Replaces the matrix strategy with two independent, conditional jobs.
- `frontend` job now runs only on pushes to `frontendDev` or `main`.
- `backend` job now runs only on pushes to `backendDev` or `main`.
- Removes the test coverage check from the deployment workflow, as it
  belongs in the `pr-checks` quality gate.
