feat(frontend): implement user profile fetching and shared types

This commit introduces the core functionality for fetching and managing
user profile data in the frontend, adhering to the project's
feature-centric architecture and ensuring type-safe communication
with the backend.

Key Changes:

- **Frontend User Profile Hook**:
  - Implemented `useUserProfile` hook (`apps/frontend/src/features/users/hooks/use-user-profile.ts`)
    to fetch authenticated user data from the backend using TanStack Query.
  - The hook leverages Clerk's authentication status to enable/disable data fetching,
    ensuring calls are made only when a user is signed in.
  - Temporarily includes a `console.log` within the hook to inspect fetched data.
  - The hook is integrated into `DashboardHeader.tsx` to ensure it's always active.

- **Shared User Profile Type**:
  - Defined `UserProfileSchema` and `UserProfileDto` (`packages/shared/src/schemas/user.schema.ts`)
    based on the Prisma User model, establishing a type-safe contract between
    frontend and backend.

- **Backend API Client Configuration**:
  - Updated `apps/frontend/src/lib/api/backend.ts` to strictly use the `BACKEND_URL`
    environment variable, resolving issues with API requests targeting the
    frontend server.
  - Added `BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001` to `apps/frontend/.env.local`
    to correctly configure the backend endpoint.

- **Dependency Management**:
  - Added `@vivero/shared` as a workspace dependency to `apps/frontend/package.json`.
  - `pnpm-lock.yaml` updated to reflect dependency changes.
