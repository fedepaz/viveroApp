fix(ci): ensure prisma client is generated for linting

The previous commit changed the Prisma client output directory, but did
not update the build process. This caused the CI `lint` job to fail as
the generated model types were not found.

This commit fixes the issue with two changes:

1.  A `postinstall` script is added to `apps/backend/package.json` to
    ensure `prisma generate` runs automatically after install.

2.  A `paths` mapping is added to `apps/backend/tsconfig.json` to point
    TypeScript and ESLint to the new location of the generated types.
