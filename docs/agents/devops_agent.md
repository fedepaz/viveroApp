**version**: 1.0

---

## Mission Statement

Deploy and scale the bulletproof Enterprise Plant Management System that converts 30-day trials into €50k+ annual contracts. Handle multi-tenant agricultural SaaS with enterprise-grade reliability, supporting 200,000+ plant records per tenant and 10+ concurrent users while maintaining sub-100ms query performance.

## System Architecture Understanding

### Core Technology Stack
```typescript
Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router) + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + TanStack Query
Backend: NestJS + Prisma + MariaDB 10.9+ + Redis 7+ + BullMQ
Infrastructure: Docker + Kubernetes + Terraform + GitHub Actions
Monitoring: DataDog/New Relic + Sentry + Prometheus + Grafana
```

### Agricultural Enterprise Requirements
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Database-per-tenant for complete data isolation
- **Scale Targets**: 200k+ plants per tenant, 10+ concurrent users, sub-100ms queries
- **Trial Strategy**: 30-day full-featured trials with seamless conversion
- **Global Reach**: Multi-region deployment (Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Canada)
- **Enterprise SLA**: 99.9% uptime, automated disaster recovery

## Deployment Modes

### Local Development Mode
**Triggers**: "local setup", "development environment", "docker-compose"
**Purpose**: Enable rapid agricultural workflow testing and plant management feature development

**Deliverables:**
- docker-compose.yml with Next.js hot reload + NestJS watch mode
- MariaDB container with agricultural seed data (sample plants, clients, suppliers)
- Redis container for caching and BullMQ job processing
- Prisma database seeding with multi-tenant test data
- Environment templates for trial system testing

### Production Deployment Mode  
**Triggers**: "production", "deployment", "go live", "enterprise infrastructure"
**Purpose**: Deploy scalable multi-tenant agricultural SaaS with trial-to-paid conversion tracking

**Deliverables:**
- Terraform infrastructure for multi-region deployment
- Kubernetes manifests with auto-scaling for agricultural peak seasons
- CI/CD pipelines with agricultural compliance testing
- Database-per-tenant provisioning automation
- Trial management automation (creation, expiration, conversion tracking)

## Agricultural-Specific DevOps Requirements

### Multi-Tenant Database Strategy
```yaml
Pattern: Database-per-tenant (complete isolation)
Rationale: 
  - GDPR compliance for European agricultural clients
  - Custom schemas per agricultural operation type
  - Easy backup/restore per client
  - Regulatory compliance (food safety, traceability)
Implementation:
  - Automated tenant provisioning via Terraform
  - Database migration coordination across tenants
  - Per-tenant backup scheduling
  - Tenant-specific performance monitoring
```

### Performance Requirements for Agricultural Scale
```yaml
Database Performance:
  - Sub-100ms queries with 200k+ plant records
  - Optimized indexes for plant lifecycle queries
  - Efficient search across plant varieties and locations
  
Concurrent User Support:
  - 10+ field workers per tenant accessing mobile interface
  - Real-time plant status updates across all users
  - Conflict resolution for simultaneous plant updates
  
API Performance:
  - Plant creation: <500ms
  - Dashboard loads: <2 seconds  
  - Report generation: <5 seconds
  - Mobile API: <200ms response times
```

### Trial System Infrastructure
```yaml
Trial Management Automation:
  - Automated 30-day trial tenant provisioning
  - Feature flag system for trial vs paid features
  - Usage analytics tracking for trial conversion insights
  - Automated trial expiration with data export options
  - Lead scoring based on plant management usage patterns

Conversion Optimization:
  - A/B testing infrastructure for trial onboarding
  - Analytics pipeline for trial user behavior
  - Automated email sequences for trial engagement
  - Seamless upgrade flow from trial to €50k+ contracts
```

### Agricultural Compliance & Security
```yaml
Data Protection:
  - End-to-end encryption for plant genetic data
  - GDPR compliance for European operations
  - Agricultural traceability audit trails
  - Secure API endpoints for IoT sensor integration

Regulatory Compliance:
  - Food safety regulation compliance
  - Agricultural certification data protection
  - Supply chain transparency requirements
  - Financial audit trails for enterprise contracts
```

## Agricultural-Specific Deployment Scripts

### Trial System Management
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/manage-trials.sh

# Create new 30-day trial tenant
create_trial() {
  local company_name=$1

  # Get list of all tenant databases
  TENANTS=$(kubectl get configmaps -l type=tenant -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}')
  
  for tenant in $TENANTS; do
    echo "Migrating tenant: $tenant"
    
    # Run Prisma migrations for each tenant
    kubectl exec deployment/plant-mgmt-backend -- \
      npx prisma migrate deploy \
      --schema=./prisma/agricultural-schema.prisma \
      --database-url="$(kubectl get secret ${tenant}-db -o jsonpath='{.data.url}' | base64 -d)"
      
    # Verify agricultural data integrity
    kubectl exec deployment/plant-mgmt-backend -- \
      npm run verify:plant-data-integrity -- --tenant=${tenant}
  done
  
  echo "All agricultural tenant migrations completed"
}
