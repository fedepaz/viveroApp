feat(backend): implement global authentication guard and remove dev guard

Refactor backend authentication by introducing a global authentication guard.
This change centralizes authentication logic and removes the development-specific
'dev.guard'. The UserService.findOrCreateUser method was also adjusted to
correctly handle tenant IDs.
