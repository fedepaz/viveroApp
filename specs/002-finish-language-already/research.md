# Research Plan for Finish Language Refactor

## Unknowns from Technical Context

### 1. Performance Goals
- **Task**: Research and define specific performance goals for the language refactor, considering factors like page load times, API response times for localized content, and client-side rendering performance.
- **Context**: The current "Technical Context" has "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" for Performance Goals.
- **Expected Outcome**: Quantifiable performance metrics (e.g., "frontend page load < 2s", "localized API response < 500ms").

### 2. Scale/Scope
- **Task**: Research and define the expected scale and scope of the language refactor, including the number of users, the volume of localized content, and the number of languages to support initially and in the future.
- **Context**: The current "Technical Context" has "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" for Scale/Scope.
- **Expected Outcome**: Clear understanding of user base, content volume, and language support roadmap.

## Technology Choices Best Practices

### 1. next-intl Best Practices
- **Task**: Find best practices for using `next-intl` in a Next.js 14 App Router environment, focusing on server and client component integration, message management, and performance optimization.
- **Context**: `next-intl` is a primary dependency for frontend internationalization.
- **Expected Outcome**: Guidelines for efficient and scalable `next-intl` implementation.

### 2. NestJS Localization Best Practices
- **Task**: Find best practices for implementing localization in a NestJS backend, specifically for API responses and database interactions with MariaDB and Prisma.
- **Context**: NestJS is the primary backend framework.
- **Expected Outcome**: Recommended patterns for localizing API data and database content.

### 3. Prisma and MariaDB Localization Strategies
- **Task**: Research different strategies for storing and retrieving localized content using Prisma with MariaDB, considering options like separate translation tables, JSON columns, or field-level suffixes.
- **Context**: Prisma and MariaDB are used for data persistence.
- **Expected Outcome**: A recommended strategy for database localization.
