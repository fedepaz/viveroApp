refactor: improve db seeding and frontend loading

This commit includes two main changes:

1. Backend (Database):
The manual prisma seed script (seed.ts) has been removed. This script was
responsible for creating a hardcoded "Development Tenant" and default user
roles. This approach is being deprecated in favor of a more dynamic and
automated tenant provisioning and seeding process.

2. Frontend (Layout):
The final fallback component in the DashboardProtectedLayout has been
changed from the ComingSoonPage to a LoadingSpinner. This provides a better
user experience for any unexpected loading states.
