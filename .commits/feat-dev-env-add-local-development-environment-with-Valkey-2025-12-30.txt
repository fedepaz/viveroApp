feat(dev-env): add local development environment with Valkey

This commit introduces a Docker-based local development environment to ensure consistency for all developers.

- A `docker-compose.yml` file has been added to the project root to manage MariaDB and Valkey services.
- Valkey was chosen over Redis as the caching and queueing backend due to its permissive open-source license and drop-in compatibility.
- All relevant agent documentation in `docs/agents/` has been updated to reflect this architectural change, replacing "Redis" with "Valkey".
