fix(ci): add build dependency to lint task

This commit configures the `lint` task in `turbo.json` to depend on
the `build` task of its workspace dependencies.

Previously, the `lint` task had no dependencies, causing Turborepo to
run it in parallel with other tasks. This led to a race condition
where the `backend` linter would run before the `@vivero/shared`
package was built, resulting in type resolution errors.

By adding `dependsOn: ["^build"]`, we ensure that all dependencies
are compiled before the linting process begins, resolving the
remaining CI failures.
