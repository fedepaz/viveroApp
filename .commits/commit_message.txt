feat(frontend): Refactor DataTable and i18n structure

This commit introduces a major refactoring of the DataTable component and the internationalization (i18n) file structure.

**DataTable Refactoring:**

*   The DataTable component has been enhanced to support bulk actions, an export dropdown, and inline editing.
*   The generic EntityModal has been replaced with a more flexible SlideOverForm for creating and editing entities.
*   A FloatingActionButton has been added for a more intuitive "add new" experience.

**i18n Refactoring:**

*   The translation files have been reorganized into a component-scoped structure, where each component has its own `messages` directory.
*   The `useTranslations` keys have been updated to reflect this new structure.
*   The `i18n/request.ts` file has been updated to dynamically load the new message files.

**UI/UX Improvements:**

*   The main dashboard layout has been improved to prevent scrolling issues.
*   The 404 Not Found page has been redesigned.

**Documentation:**

*   The `GEMINI.md` file has been updated with new workflows for the agent.
*   The `docs/translation_workflow.md` file has been completely rewritten to document the new i18n structure and provide a clear guide for developers.
