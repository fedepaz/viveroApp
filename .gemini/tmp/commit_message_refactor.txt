refactor(backend): use ConfigService for auth strategy and namespace NODE_ENV

Refactored the `AuthModule` to use `ConfigService` for selecting the
authentication strategy (`DevAuthStrategy` or `ClerkAuthStrategy`) based on the
environment. This centralizes configuration access and improves testability.

Renamed the environment variable from `NODE_ENV` to `BACKEND_NODE_ENV` in
`configuration.ts` to prevent conflicts with other applications in the
monorepo.

The `authStrategyProvider` now correctly injects and uses the `ConfigService`
to retrieve the environment, making the strategy selection more robust and
aligned with NestJS best practices.
