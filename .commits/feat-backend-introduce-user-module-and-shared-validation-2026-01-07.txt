feat(backend): introduce user module and shared validation

This commit introduces a significant architectural enhancement by
extracting user profile management into a dedicated `users` module and
establishing a shared validation layer using Zod.

Key Changes:

- **User Module**:
  - A new `users` module handles user profile operations
    (`GET /users/me`, `PATCH /users/me`).
  - This separates user profile management from the `auth` module,
    improving modularity.

- **Shared Package & Validation**:
  - A new workspace package `@vivero/shared` is introduced to hold data
    contracts (DTOs) and Zod schemas.
  - A `ZodValidationPipe` provides robust, schema-based validation for
    incoming requests.
  - The `PATCH /users/me` endpoint now validates its body against the
    `UpdateUserProfileSchema`.

- **Auth Refactoring**:
  - The repository in the `auth` module is renamed to
    `UserAuthRepository` to clarify its role.

This refactoring improves Separation of Concerns, enforces type-safe
DTOs, and establishes a scalable pattern for validation.
