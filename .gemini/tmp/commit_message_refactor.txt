refactor(backend): apply repository pattern to auth module and cleanup

This commit refactors the backend application, focusing on the `auth` module
to introduce a repository pattern for data access. This change improves
separation of concerns and testability.

Key changes:
- Introduced `UserRepository` to abstract data access logic for users.
- `AuthService` now uses `UserRepository` instead of `PrismaService` directly.
- Removed the generic `AppController`, `AppService`, and their tests to
  streamline the application root.
- Cleaned up `app.module.ts` by removing unused providers and controllers.
- Reorganized `auth` module structure, including moving `GlobalAuthGuard`.
