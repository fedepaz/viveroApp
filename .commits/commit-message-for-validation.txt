chore(deps): update all dependencies

This commit updates all dependencies across the monorepo to their latest compatible versions.
This resolves a high-severity vulnerability in the 'qs' package.

Note: Frontend still shows peer dependency warnings related to React 19 compatibility
with some UI and auth libraries, which will be addressed in future work if necessary.
