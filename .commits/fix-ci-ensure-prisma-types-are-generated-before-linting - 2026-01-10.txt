fix(ci): ensure prisma types are generated before linting

This commit resolves a CI failure where type-aware linting rules were
failing due to missing Prisma type definitions.

- The `lint` script in `apps/backend/package.json` has been corrected to
  use a more accurate glob pattern.

- A `postinstall` script (`prisma generate`) has been added to the
  `apps/backend/package.json` to ensure that the Prisma client and its
  associated types are generated after `pnpm install`, making them
  available to ESLint during the linting process.
