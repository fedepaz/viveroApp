feat(ui): refactor mobile navigation and simplify header

Refactors the mobile navigation to use a collapsible, grouped structure, aligning it with the desktop sidebar's user experience. This change improves organization and scannability on mobile devices.

- Implements a collapsible accordion menu in the mobile navigation sheet.
- Simplifies the main dashboard header by removing the search bar and settings button for a more minimal design.
- Deletes the redundant `BottomNavigation` component.
- Internationalizes navigation group titles ("Operations", "Management", "Administration") across all layout components and translation files.
