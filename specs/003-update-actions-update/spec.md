# Feature Specification: Update Actions and Agent Definitions

**Feature Branch**: `003-update-actions-update`  
**Created**: 2025-09-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "update actions---- update gemini.md with agents, and create the actions for ci/cd"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer, I want to update the `GEMINI.md` file to define the roles of different AI agents and create the corresponding CI/CD workflows, so that the development process is automated and agents have clear instructions.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the `GEMINI.md` file exists, **When** the `GEMINI.md` file is updated, **Then** it should contain clear definitions for each AI agent's role and responsibilities.
2. **Given** the project requires automated builds and deployments, **When** new CI/CD actions are created, **Then** the project should have workflows for continuous integration and deployment.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if the `GEMINI.md` file is missing or has incorrect formatting?
- How will the system handle failures in the CI/CD pipeline?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The `GEMINI.md` file MUST be updated to include a clear definition of roles and responsibilities for various AI agents.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST have CI/CD actions (workflows) for automating build, test, and deployment processes.
- **FR-003**: The specific AI agents and their designated roles (e.g., 'frontend-agent', 'backend-agent', 'devops-agent')? are on the `GEMINI.md` file, and on the docs/agents folder.
- **FR-004**: The specific CI/CD actions (workflows) are on the cicd-agent.md, on the docs/agents folder, thats new, and thats the update that needs to be done on the `GEMINI.md` file.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **GEMINI.md**: A markdown file that acts as a constitution for AI agents, defining their purpose, rules, and behavior.
- **CI/CD Workflows**: A set of YAML files located in `.github/workflows` that define the automated pipeline for continuous integration and deployment.
