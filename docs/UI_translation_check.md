# UI Translation Check for {feature} Feature

This document outlines the steps taken to identify and internationalize hardcoded strings within the `{feature}` feature of the frontend application.

## 1. Initial Analysis and File Structure Review

- **Objective**: Understand the project's coding and internationalization (i18n) conventions.
- **Action**: Reviewed `GEMINI.md` and `docs/agents/frontend-agent-guide.md` to understand the feature-sliced architecture and the component-scoped translation strategy.
- **Findings**: The project uses `next-intl` for i18n, with translation files (`en.json`, `es.json`, `it.json`) located in a `messages` subdirectory within each component's folder.

## 2. Identification of Hardcoded Strings

- **Objective**: Locate all user-facing strings that were not being translated.
- **Action**: Manually inspected the files in `apps/frontend/src/features/{feature}/components/`.
- **Findings**: Identified several hardcoded strings, including component titles, descriptions, labels, and other UI text.

## 3. Internationalization Implementation

- **Objective**: Replace the hardcoded strings with calls to the `useTranslations` hook.
- **Action**:
  - In each of the affected components, imported the `useTranslations` hook from `next-intl`.
  - Replaced each hardcoded string with a `t('key')` function call, where `key` is a unique identifier for that string.

## 4. Translation Key Creation and File Updates

- **Objective**: Add the new translation keys and their corresponding translations to the appropriate JSON files.
- **Action**: Updated the translation files for English (`en`), Spanish (`es`), and Italian (`it`) in `apps/frontend/src/features/{feature}/components/{Component}/messages/`.

## 5. Verification

- **Objective**: Ensure that the new translation keys were correctly loaded by the application.
- **Action**: Inspected `apps/frontend/src/i18n/request.ts`.
- **Findings**: Confirmed that the `request.ts` file already included the necessary `import` statements to load the translation files for the feature's components. If not, add the import statements.
