fix(ci): prevent vercel build failure from prisma generate

The `postinstall` script in `apps/backend/package.json` was causing Vercel
frontend builds to fail because `prisma generate` was executed without
the necessary `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

This commit resolves the issue by:
- Removing the `postinstall` script.
- Integrating `prisma generate` directly into the backend's `build` script.
This ensures that `prisma generate` only runs when the backend is explicitly
being built, avoiding conflicts in monorepo CI/CD environments where
frontend-only builds are performed.
