feat(db): enhance audit log with enums and document db workflow

This commit improves the database schema and developer workflow by:

1.  Enhancing the `AuditLog` table to use `ENUM` types for the `action`
    and `entityType` fields. This improves data integrity and query
    performance. A new index was also added on the `action` field.

2.  Documenting the official `Database Schema Change Workflow` in `GEMINI.md`
    to ensure all future database changes are made safely and consistently.

3.  Adding a `db:validate` script to run `prisma validate` as part of the
    newly documented workflow.
