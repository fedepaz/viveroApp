fix(ci): update PR checks to use pnpm run commands

Updates the `.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml` file to use `pnpm run lint` and
`pnpm run test` instead of direct `turbo run` commands.

This resolves the "turbo: command not found" error in the GitHub Actions
environment, ensuring that CI checks for pull requests execute correctly.
