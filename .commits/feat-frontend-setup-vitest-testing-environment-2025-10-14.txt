feat(frontend): setup Vitest testing environment

This commit sets up the Vitest testing environment for the frontend application.

Key changes include:
- Installation of necessary testing dependencies (@testing-library/react,
  jsdom, @vitejs/plugin-react).
- Configuration of Vitest in `vitest.config.mts` to correctly handle Next.js,
  React, and `next-intl` modules.
- Creation of `vitest.setup.ts` for global test setup, including a mock for
  `next-intl`'s `useTranslations` hook.
- Implementation of a test-specific PostCSS configuration in
  `postcss.config.test.mjs` to resolve conflicts with Next.js's PostCSS
  processing.
- Addition of a component test for `RootDashboard` (`RootDashboard.test.tsx`)
  to verify the setup.
- Modification of `kpi-card-skeleton.tsx` to include a `data-testid` for
  testability.

This setup ensures that frontend components can be reliably unit and component
tested, aligning with the project's TDD and quality standards.
