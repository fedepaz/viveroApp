docs(agent): refine commit workflow in GEMINI.md

Updates the "Workflow for Committing and Pushing New Work" in GEMINI.md.

This change adds an explicit step for generating and internally validating
commit messages against the project's commitlint rules. This ensures
all proposed commits are compliant before the pre-commit hooks run.
