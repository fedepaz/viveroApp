fix(ci): provide dummy DATABASE_URL for pr checks

The "Check for pending migrations" step in the `pr-checks.yml` workflow was
failing because `prisma migrate dev --create-only` requires `DATABASE_URL`
to load `prisma.config.ts`, but it was not provided in the CI environment.

This commit resolves the issue by:
- Adding a dummy `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (`sqlite:./dev.db`)
  specifically to the "Check for pending migrations" step.
This allows Prisma to load the configuration and perform the schema validation
without needing a real database connection, ensuring the PR checks pass
correctly.
