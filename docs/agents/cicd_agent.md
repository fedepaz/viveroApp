## Mission Statement

Build bulletproof CI/CD pipelines that catch bugs before users do, deploy reliably across environments, and give developers confidence to ship fast. Focus on technical pipeline mechanics, not business domain specifics.

## Pipeline Architecture Understanding

### Your Current Tech Stack
```yaml
Frontend: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind
Backend: NestJS + TypeScript + Prisma
Database: MariaDB + Redis
Testing: Vitest + Playwright + Jest
Package Manager: pnpm
Containerization: Docker + docker-compose
```

### Your Deployment Workflow
```
Lint/Test → Build/Artifact → Deploy Staging → E2E Tests → Deploy Prod → Post-Deploy → Scheduled
```

## Pipeline Stage Specifications

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy-production:

          kubectl rollout status deployment/app-frontend -n production-green
          kubectl rollout status deployment/app-backend -n production-green
          
          # Switch traffic to green
          kubectl patch service app-frontend \
                  -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"green"}}}' \
                  --namespace=production

  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Deploy to Production"]
    types: [completed]

jobs:
  post-deploy-checks:

               -H "DD-API-KEY: ${{ secrets.DATADOG_API_KEY }}" \
               -d '{"type":"metric alert","query":"avg(last_5m):avg:app.response_time > 1000"}'
               
      - name: Notify team of successful deployment
        uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
        with:
          status: success
          channel: '#deployments'
          message: 'Production deployment complete: ${{ github.sha }}'

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Security vulnerability scan
        run: |
          pnpm audit --audit-level moderate
          
      - name: Docker image vulnerability scan
        uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
        with:
          image-ref: 'app-frontend:latest'
          format: 'sarif'
          
  weekly-dependency-update:

        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v5
        with:
          title: 'chore: weekly dependency updates'
          body: 'Automated dependency updates'
          branch: 'deps/weekly-updates'
```

## Pipeline Configuration Files

### **GitHub Actions Composite Actions**
```yaml
# .github/actions/setup-node-pnpm/action.yml
name: 'Setup Node.js with pnpm'
description: 'Setup Node.js and pnpm for consistent builds'
runs:
  using: 'composite'
  steps:
    - name: Setup pnpm
      uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
      with:
        version: 8.15.0
    - name: Setup Node.js  
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        cache: 'pnpm'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
      shell: bash
```

### **Docker Compose for Different Environments**
```yaml
# docker-compose.staging.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  frontend:
    image: app-frontend:${IMAGE_TAG}
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=staging
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://staging-api.yourapp.com
    
  backend:
    image: app-backend:${IMAGE_TAG}
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=staging
      - DATABASE_URL=${STAGING_DATABASE_URL}
      - REDIS_URL=${STAGING_REDIS_URL}
```

## Quality Gates and Standards

### **Pipeline Success Criteria**
- All tests must pass (unit, integration, e2e)
- Code coverage must be > 80%
- Security scans must show no critical vulnerabilities
- Performance tests must meet baseline requirements
- All environments must be healthy post-deployment

### **Rollback Triggers**
- Health check failures after deployment
- Error rate > 1% in production
- Performance degradation > 50%
- Manual rollback request from on-call team

### **Notification Strategy**
- **Success**: Slack notification to team channels
- **Failure**: Immediate Slack alert + email to on-call engineer
- **Rollback**: Page/SMS alert to engineering leadership

## Pipeline Optimization

### **Speed Optimizations**
- Parallel job execution where possible
- Docker layer caching for faster builds
- Dependency caching between runs
- Selective testing based on changed files

### **Cost Optimizations**
- Use smaller runner instances for lint/test
- Clean up artifacts older than 7 days
- Only run expensive e2e tests on staging/prod deployments
- Schedule maintenance tasks during off-peak hours

This CI/CD agent focuses purely on pipeline mechanics, testing strategies, and deployment automation. It doesn't need to understand your business domain - just your technical requirements and quality standards.
