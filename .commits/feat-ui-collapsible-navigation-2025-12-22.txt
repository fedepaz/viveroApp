feat(ui): implement collapsible navigation groups in desktop sidebar

Introduces a new grouped and collapsible navigation structure to the
desktop sidebar, enhancing organization and user experience for managing
various application sections.

- Refactors sidebar navigation to categorize links into logical groups
  (e.g., "Operations", "Management", "Administration").
- Implements expand/collapse functionality for navigation groups,
  managed by component state.
- Integrates new Lucide React icons (`Building`, `Settings`, `ChevronDown`)
  to support the grouped UI.
- Removes the unused `Separator` component from the sidebar.
- Updates `agricultural-ux-ui-agent.md` to document the new sidebar
  navigation pattern, promoting consistency in future UI development.
