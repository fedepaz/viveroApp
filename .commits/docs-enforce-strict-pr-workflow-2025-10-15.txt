docs: enforce strict pull request workflow in GEMINI.md

Updated the GEMINI.md file to explicitly enforce that pull requests must target
`frontendDev` or `backendDev` branches, and never `main`. This change
replaces "should" with "must" for clarity and strict adherence to the
project's Git workflow.
