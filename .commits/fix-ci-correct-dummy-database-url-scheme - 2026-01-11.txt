fix(ci): correct dummy DATABASE_URL scheme for pr checks

The "Check for pending migrations" step in the `pr-checks.yml` workflow was
failing because the provided `DATABASE_URL` with a `sqlite` scheme was
incompatible with the backend's Prisma setup which uses a `mysql` provider.

This commit resolves the issue by:
- Changing the dummy `DATABASE_URL` to use a `mysql://` scheme (e.g.,
  `mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/testdb`).
This ensures that Prisma can correctly load the configuration and perform
schema validation during PR checks without requiring a real database connection.
