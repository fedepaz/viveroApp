fix(auth): synchronize user data on every login

Previously, when a user authenticated via Clerk, their information was only
fetched and stored upon their initial registration. On subsequent logins,
the system would find the existing user record but would not update it,
leading to stale data if the user's profile information (e.g., name, email)
had changed in Clerk.

This commit addresses the issue by implementing an update mechanism
within the `findOrCreateUser` service.

- A new `updateUser` method has been added to the `UserAuthRepository` to
  facilitate updating user records.
- The `AuthService` now compares the incoming user data from Clerk with
  the existing database record.
- If there are any discrepancies in the user's `email`, `firstName`, or
  `lastName`, the `updateUser` method is called to synchronize the data.
- Enhanced logging in `ClerkAuthStrategy` to provide better visibility
  into the authentication and user synchronization process.

This ensures that the user's profile in the local database is always
kept in sync with the information from the authentication provider.
