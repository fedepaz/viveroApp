refactor(backend): split prisma schema into multiple files

The Prisma schema has been refactored from a single `schema.prisma` file
into a directory of smaller, model-specific files.

This modular approach improves organization and maintainability of the
database schema, especially as the number of models grows.

The `apps/backend/package.json` has been updated to point to the new schema
directory.
