docs(agents): update documentation for modular backend and CI/CD

This commit updates several agent documentation files to reflect the new
modular backend architecture and NestJS best practices.

The changes include:
- `agricultural-backend-agent.md`: Added a new step in the development
  workflow to explicitly relocate generated modules to `src/modules/`.
- `shared-package-agent.md`: Clarified that DTOs and entities from all
  backend feature modules are sources for shared types and schemas.
- `qa_agent.md`: Updated backend unit and integration test examples to
  reflect the `src/modules/` path.
- `tdd_cicd_guide.md`: Updated `PrismaService` import path and backend
  unit/integration test examples.
- `cicd_agent.md`: Clarified `turbo run` commands with explicit filters
  for backend and frontend applications in CI/CD workflows.
