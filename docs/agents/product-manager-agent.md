### Skeleton Loading Screen Pattern: A Core UX Requirement

To ensure a modern, enterprise-grade user experience, the implementation of skeleton loading screens is a mandatory requirement for all data-fetching features.

#### Context and Purpose

From a product perspective, skeleton screens are not just a technical detail; they are a crucial element of perceived performance. They provide a better user experience than traditional spinners by managing user expectations and reducing cognitive load. This makes the application feel faster and more professional, which is critical for converting trial users into paying enterprise clients.

#### Product Requirements

- **Mandatory for Data-Fetching Features**: Any feature that loads data from the backend must display a skeleton screen during the initial load.
- **Must Mimic the Real UI**: The skeleton screen must be a high-fidelity placeholder of the final layout. It should have the same structure, spacing, and general shape as the content that will eventually load.
- **Consistency is Key**: The skeleton loading experience must be consistent across the entire application.

#### QA Checklist for Product Managers

When reviewing a new feature, product managers must verify the following:

- [ ] Does the feature display a skeleton screen on the initial data load?
- [ ] Does the skeleton screen accurately represent the layout of the real content?
- [ ] Is the loading experience free of jarring layout shifts when the real content loads?
- [ ] Is the skeleton screen used in place of generic loading spinners?
