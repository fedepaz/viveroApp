feat(backend): establish core auth and database foundation

This commit lays the foundational groundwork for the backend application, focusing on authentication, multi-tenancy, and database setup.

Key changes include:

- **Database Schema**:
  - Added `Tenant`, `User`, `Role`, and `AuditLog` models to the Prisma schema to support multi-tenancy and role-based access control (RBAC).
  - Implemented robust `onDelete` rules (`Cascade`, `Restrict`) and added indexes for critical query paths to ensure data integrity and performance.
  - Added an `isActive` field to the `User` model for soft-delete capabilities.
  - Applied the initial database migration (`init`).

- **Prisma Integration**:
  - Established a global `PrismaModule` and `PrismaService` to provide a singleton, injectable database client for the NestJS application, replacing the previous empty placeholder files.
  - Verified the database connection is successfully established on application startup.

- **Authentication Scaffolding**:
  - Scaffolded the core `AuthModule` using the NestJS CLI.
  - Created a `ClerkService` within the `auth` module to handle JWT validation with the Clerk SDK.
  - Updated `AuthService` with `findOrCreateUser` logic to provision users from Clerk JWTs into the local database.

- **Configuration**:
  - Updated the backend configuration (`configuration.ts`) to use "valkey" instead of "redis" for consistency.
  - Optimized the `docker-compose.yml` for MariaDB and Valkey with improved performance settings and logging configurations.
