refactor(auth): use default tenant ID in authentication flow

This commit refactors the authentication strategy to use a default
tenant ID from the configuration instead of extracting it from the
Clerk JWT payload.

This simplifies the development setup by removing the dependency on the
tenant ID being present in the Clerk token. The application now falls
back to a `DEFAULT_TENANT_ID` environment variable.
