refactor(backend): migrate from @clerk/express to @clerk/backend

This commit migrates the backend authentication from `@clerk/express`
to the `@clerk/backend` SDK. This aligns with Clerk's latest
recommendations and simplifies the authentication logic.

Key changes:
- Replaced `@clerk/express` with `@clerk/backend`.
- Streamlined the `AuthStrategy` interface.
- Refactored `DevAuthStrategy` for better dependency injection.
