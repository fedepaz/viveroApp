docs(workflow): add pull request message generation workflow to GEMINI.md

This commit introduces a new workflow to GEMINI.md, detailing the process for
generating comprehensive Pull Request titles and descriptions.

The new workflow covers:
- Identifying the target branch.
- Reviewing commits on the feature branch.
- Drafting the PR title and description based on the entire feature.
- Establishing a naming convention for saving drafted PR messages in the
  `.pull_requests/` directory.
- Emphasizing review and refinement of the drafted message.

This formalizes the process for creating clear and informative Pull Requests,
improving communication and code review efficiency.
