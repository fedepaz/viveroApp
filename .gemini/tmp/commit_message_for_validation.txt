refactor(backend): migrate from @clerk/express to @clerk/backend

This commit migrates the backend authentication from `@clerk/express` to the
`@clerk/backend` SDK. This aligns with Clerk's latest recommendations and
simplifies the authentication logic.

Key changes:
- Replaced `@clerk/express` with `@clerk/backend`.
- Streamlined the `AuthStrategy` interface implementations.
- Refactored `ClerkAuthStrategy` and `DevAuthStrategy` to directly use
  `@clerk/backend` for token verification and environment checks.
- Introduced `ClerkJWTPayload` for type-safe handling of Clerk JWTs.
- Improved tenant ID extraction from Clerk payload.
