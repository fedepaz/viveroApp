feat(auth): implement robust auth state handling and serverless DB adapter

Introduces a comprehensive system for managing authentication state
on the frontend and optimizes the database connection for serverless
environments on the backend.

Frontend:
- A new `AuthUserProfileProvider` and `useAuthUserProfile` hook replace
  the previous user profile fetching logic.
- A `DashboardProtectedLayout` is introduced to act as a state machine
  for the user session, handling multiple states gracefully:
  - **Loading:** A unified loading state for both Clerk session and
    backend profile fetching.
  - **Database Unavailable:** A specific error page is shown if the
    backend API fails, indicating the database may be asleep.
  - **Pending Permissions:** A dedicated page for authenticated users
    whose profiles are not yet fully provisioned.
- This provides a more resilient and user-friendly experience for
  edge cases in a serverless architecture.

Backend:
- The Prisma service is refactored to use `@prisma/adapter-mariadb`.
- This is essential for managing connections to serverless databases
  (like Vercel Postgres, Neon, etc.) by enabling connection pooling.
- The configuration is updated to use a single `DATABASE_URL` for
  simplicity and compatibility with hosting provider environments.
- The Clerk auth strategy now correctly parses user names from
  different JWT claims (`given_name`/`family_name`).
