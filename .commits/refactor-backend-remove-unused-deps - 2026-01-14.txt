refactor(backend): remove unused dependencies and document for future use

Remove a significant number of unused dependencies from the backend
application to reduce bloat, improve security posture, and decrease
installation times.

Following a `depcheck` analysis, these packages were identified as
unused and have been removed from `apps/backend/package.json`.

The removed packages have been documented in the
`agricultural-backend-agent.md` guide under a new "Recommended
Future Modules" section to preserve the rationale for their
potential future use.
